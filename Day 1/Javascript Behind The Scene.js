// Javascript Behind The Scene//

We generally run js in an environment. It can be our browser or it can be any other application program like node.js. Where we run js, there is a javascript engine exists there like Google V8 Engine, Spider Monkey, JavaScript Core etc 

Javascript code execution steps:

CODE ---> PARSER (read code line by line) ---> CONVERT THEM TO MACHINE CODE ---> CODE RUNS
                                           |                                 |
                                           |                                 | 
                                           |                                 |
                                Abstract Syntax Tree                    Machine CODE

// Steps:

1. Write code
//JS Engine Part:
2. This code goes in parser. Here it checks syntax error. If it finds syntax error then it throws an error. Otherwise, Abstract Syntax Tree (a data structure)  is created from Parser.
3. In this step, code will convert to machine code, the computer/machine will understand the code.
4. Last step, Code will run.


//Execution Context and Execution stack//

//Execution Context:
//By Default Js executes Global context, It's not like other languages that execute from a specific function.
//Global context of JS is the Browser's "window" object. Any global variable declares or assigns in the window object is the same thing.

//example:

var x = 5;

window.x;

//output: 10 ( It will show the same value)

//But if your environment is not a browser then it will change with the environment. Example: for node.js, it will be "global" object.

//Execution Stack:

//Example: 

var name = 'Mahir'; -------------------- 1 (Global Execution Context )
function first() { --------------------- 2
   var welcome = 'Hi '; ------------- 6
   second(); --------------------------- 7
   console.log(welcome + name);--------- 13
}
function second() {--------------------- 3
   var welcome2 = 'Hello! ';--------------- 8
   third();----------------------------- 9
   console.log(welcome2 + name);-------- 12
}
function third() {---------------------- 4
   var welcome3 = 'Hey! ';-------------- 10
   console.log(welcome3 + name); ------- 11
}
first();-------------------------------- 5

//Execution Stack follows First In Last Out System. Execution Stack serial

//Explanation (summery) :

// var name = 'Mahir'; is First In / Global Execution Context (1)

// Execution Context second- first() (2)

//  Execution Context third - second() (3)

// Execution Context four-  third() (4)

// Please check serial for execution sequence

// First thing will pop  "Execution Context four"  after finishing the execution from the stack, then will pop "Execution Context third", "Execution Context second".

//Let's go to a little bit deep of Execution Context: 

//When we call a function then it happens two phases: 

//1. Creation Phase: In the creation phase, first of all, it creates a variable object. then it creates scope chain and lastly, determine the value of 'this' variable.

// *Explanation: 
// The argument object is created, containing all the arguments that were passed into the function.
// Code is scanned for function declaration: for each function, a property is created in the variable object, pointing to the function
//Code is scanned for variable declarations: for each variable, a property is created in the variable object, and set to undefined

//2.Execution phase: The code of the function that generated the current execution context is run line by line.
